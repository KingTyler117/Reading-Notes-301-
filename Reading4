<h1> CSS Grid Layout</h1>

 <p> This was really intresting playing around with. I was able to learn alt of useful things I can use for the futrue for my CSS projects.
 I found it really intreesting how helpful this site was. All of these tools are very powerful for CSS. 
 This has helped me to realize that even just a little bit of CSS on a site can make any old boring webpage a more'
 intresting one.


<h2> Regular Expressions</h2>

<p> RegExr was created by gskinner.com. They are normally used for extracting information from any text. You can search for  matches of a specific search pattern.
This is another pretty powerful tool that can help to get things done. I found the guide for this to be very helpful for trying to get
a basic level knowledge of the subject. I am looking forward to getting a hang of it in the futrue. Some expamples of it are

. any character except newline

\w\d\s word, digit, whitespace

<p> For this code, it is a Quantifiers & Alternation. One example of this is a+?a{2,}?. This means it will match as few as possible
