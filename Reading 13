<h2> Updating and Deleting </h2>

<p> The most basic way to describe it is as follows, 
web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) 
sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), 
using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol. what is on a HTML page is a easy way to be able to
to send HTTP data to the server.  The form elment will define what type of data will be sent.The action attribute
will tell the data where it needs to go. Las thing to know is that the method attrtibute will define how the data will
be sent.</p>
